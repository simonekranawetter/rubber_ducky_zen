## Introduction: Meet Rubber Ducky Zen - A Peaceful Web App for Debugging and Relaxing

Rubber Ducky Zen is a web application built using Vue.js and TypeScript, and is hosted on Vercel. The idea for this app came to me during my final internship, when I was struggling with imposter syndrome and needed some debugging help.

## The Tech Stack - How Rubber Ducky Zen came to Life

The app's beautiful - or slightly questionable - design features, such as original images were created by Midjourney, while the playful and memorable name "Rubber Ducky Zen" was suggested by ChatGPT. It is also paying tribute to the age-old practice of rubber duck debugging, a technique that I have come to love since I started programming. It was made during long, caffinated nights and weekends and will hopefully bring someone joy during long and guesome debugging sessions.

## Rubber Duck Debugging and Programming: A Love Story

The concept behind rubber duck debugging is simple yet effective - if you explain your code line by line to a rubber duck and work through it together, the solution to your problem will come to you and you can fix it.

The ultimate goal of Rubber Ducky Zen is to provide a quick fun break during the workday. While the app is inspired by the concept of rubber duck debugging and is certainly a helpful tool for fellow programmers, it's also intended to be a fun and enjoyable experience for anyone needing a quick break from the demands of their day-to-day life. Whether you're a developer looking for a debugging buddy or just seeking a little bit of positivity, I hope that Rubber Ducky Zen will be a source of joy for you.
