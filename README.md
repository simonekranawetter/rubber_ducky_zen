## Introduction: Meet Rubber Ducky Zen - A Peaceful Web App for Debugging and Relaxing

Rubber Ducky Zen is a web application built using Vue.js and TypeScript, and is hosted on Vercel. The idea for this app came to me during my final internship, when I was struggling with imposter syndrome and needed some debugging help.

## The Tech Stack - How Rubber Ducky Zen came about

The app's beautiful - or slightly questionable - design features such as original images were created by Midjourney, while the playful and memorable name "Rubber Ducky Zen" was suggested by ChatGPT. The app's ultimate goal is to provide a peaceful and calming space for users to unwind and focus on their mental and emotional wellbeing, while also paying tribute to the age-old practice of rubber duck debugging, a technique that I have come to love since I started programming.

## Rubber Duck Debugging and Programming: A Love Story

The concept behind rubber duck debugging is simple yet effective - if you explain your code line by line to a rubber duck and work through it together, the solution to your problem will come to you and you can fix it. This project is my final exam for EC Utbildning.

The ultimate goal of Rubber Ducky Zen is to provide a peaceful and calming space for users to unwind and focus on their mental and emotional wellbeing. While the app is inspired by the concept of rubber duck debugging and is certainly a helpful tool for fellow programmers, it's also intended to be a fun and enjoyable experience for anyone needing a quick break from the demands of their day-to-day life. Whether you're a developer looking for a debugging buddy or just seeking a moment of tranquility, we hope that Rubber Ducky Zen will be a source of comfort and relaxation for you.
