# Rubber Ducky Zen
<img src=https://rubber-ducky-zen.vercel.app/assets/logo-7ae3371d.png width="200">

This project was born out of my own experience battling imposter syndrome during my final internship, where I found solace in the practice of rubber duck debugging.

Developed during late nights and weekends, this app aims to bring joy and assistance to programmers enduring arduous debugging sessions.

Whether you're a developer in need of a debugging companion or simply craving a touch of positivity, Rubber Ducky Zen is here to provide a moment of relaxation and enjoyment.
